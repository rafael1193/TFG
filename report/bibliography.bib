First, design concepts of a {WBS} are presented, with emphasis on the ring sensor developed by the author's group at {MIT}. The ring sensor is an ambulatory, telemetric, continuous health-monitoring device. This {WBS} combines miniaturized data acquisition features with advanced photoplethysmographic ({PPG}) techniques to acquire data related to the patient's cardiovascular state using a method that is far superior to existing fingertip {PPG} sensors. In particular, the ring sensor is capable of reliably monitoring a patient's heart rate, oxygen saturation, and heart rate variability. Technical issues, including motion artifact, interference with blood circulation, and battery power issues, are addressed, and effective engineering solutions to alleviate these problems are presented. Second, based on the ring sensor technology the clinical potentials of {WBS} monitoring are addressed.},

Two case studies illustrate this process: the development of a paper-based device to measure liver function, and the development of a device to identify sickle cell disease based on aqueous multiphase systems ({AMPS}) and differences in the densities of normal and sickled cells. Details of developing these devices provide strategies for forming partnerships, prototyping devices, designing studies, and evaluating {POC} diagnostics.

Based on a model for the attenuation of light through skin, tissue, bone, and blood, suitable processing steps are identified so that the analytical expression derived for the estimation of {SpO}2 becomes free of not only patient but sensor-dependent parameters as well.

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel technique for heart rate measurement on a standing subject is proposed that relies on electrical impedance variations detected by a plantar interface with booth feet, such as those in some bathroom weighting scales for body composition analysis. Heart-related impedance variations in the legs come from arterial blood circulation and are below 500 {mOmega}. To detect them, we have implemented a system with a gain in excess of 600, and whose fully differential {AC} input amplifier has a gain of 4.5 and a common-mode rejection ratio ({CMRR}) higher than 90 {dB} at 10 {kHz}. Differential coherent demodulation based on synchronous sampling yields a signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) of about 54 {dB}. The system sensitivity is 610 {mV}/Omega. The technique has been demonstrated on 18 volunteers, whose bioimpedance signal and {ECG} were simultaneously recorded. A Bland-Altman plot shows a mean bias of -0.2 ms between the {RR} time intervals obtained from these two signals, which is negligible. The technique is simple and user friendly and does not require any additional sensors or electrodes attached to the body, hence no conductive gel or skin preparation.},

	abstract = {Heart rate monitoring from wrist-type photoplethysmographic ({PPG}) signals during subjects' intensive exercise is a difficult problem, since the {PPG} signals are contaminated by extremely strong motion artifacts caused by subjects' hand movements. In this work, we formulate the heart rate estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery problem, and use a sparse signal recovery algorithm to calculate high-resolution power spectra of {PPG} signals, from which heart rates are estimated by selecting corresponding spectrum peaks. To facilitate the use of sparse signal recovery, we propose using bandpass filtering, singular spectrum analysis, and temporal difference operation to partially remove motion artifacts and sparsify {PPG} spectra. The proposed method was tested on {PPG} recordings from 10 subjects who were fast running at the peak speed of 15km/hour. The results showed that the averaged absolute estimation error was only 2.56 Beats/Minute, or 1.94\% error compared to ground-truth heart rates from simultaneously recorded {ECG}.},

The entire system is comprised to several parts such as heart rate module, computer Graphic User Interface ({GUI}) and Bluetooth module. The {HR} module is used to pick up heart rate signal from the subject (patients) and sends it (signal) wirelessly to computer or server using Bluetooth transceiver. This system can be incorporated and integrated as a part of telemedicine component. The data received from heart rate module can be saved and view for further medical usage such as to get hourly or daily data. The result from this project shown great outcome, indeed we had tested the Bluetooth's signal of this system within our building facilities which blocked by gypsum's partition and the signal can be transmitted between 15 to 20 meters radius. Some issue that can be improve for this system such as sizing and arrangement of the components so that it can be custom made in compact sizing and more convenient to the users for mobility purpose.},
